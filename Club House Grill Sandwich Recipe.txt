Club House Grill Sandwich Recipe

Ingredients:
For each sandwich:
2 slices of french bread 
1 Tbsp softened butter or margarine
1/2 Tbsp mayonnaise 
1/3 C shredded cheddar cheese 
2 thin slices turkey breast
2 thin slices ham 
2 slices tomato (optional)
1 Tbsp bbq sauce
Instructions:
Heat a large skillet.
Butter one side of each slice of bread.
Place one slice in skillet, butter-side down, and spread the top with mayonnaise.
Sprinkle half of cheese on mayonnaise.
Place turkey slices in skillet, next to bread, and ham slices on top of turkey.
After 30 seconds, flip the meat.
Lay turkey on the heating bread and cheese.
Put tomato slices on turkey.
Spread bbq sauce on tomato.
Lay ham on top.
Sprinkle on the rest of the cheese.
Place second slice of bread on top, butter-side up.
Flip sandwich over and brown for another 2 to 3 minutes. Both sides of sandwich should be browned and the cheese melting.

With a large enough skillet, you can have three spots - sandwich bottom, meat, sandwich top - through which you rotate the sandwiches, making one every 2 minutes.
