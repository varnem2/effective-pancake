Barbeque Hamburger Recipe

Ingredients:
3 lb. hamburger
1 large onion, chopped
1 pint ketchup
1 pint tomato juice
3 Tbsp flour
1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp curry powder
salt and pepper
(optional) cayenne pepper powder or hot sauce for a kick
10 hamburger buns
Instructions:
Heat dutch oven to 350 for Frying.
Brown hamburger and onion, breaking into small bits and cooking thoroughly.
Drain off grease.
Pour in ketchup, tomato juice, and season with salt and pepper (and cayenne pepper or hot sauce if desired).
Bring to a boil while stirring.
Dissolve flour and curry powder in a cup with worcestershire sauce and enough water to thin the mixture.
Mix into hamburger.
Simmer at about 225 degrees for an hour or so.

Serve 8-12 people on buns with french fries or potato chips made in a dutch oven.
Hamburger buns come in 10 packs, so that works nicely.
