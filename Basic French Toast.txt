1 loaf sandwich bread
syrup
Instructions:
2 Tbsp oil
8 eggs

1 Tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1 loaf sandwich bread

Beat eggs in bowl with fork.
Whip in milk, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and oil.

Heat skillet to medium, not too hot.
Spray skillet with oil.
Using fork, quickly dip a slice of bread in eggs, flip, poke and lift to let excess drain off, then lay in skillet. Doing this quickly to just coat the bread without soaking it is key.

Cook one side of bread. When it gets browned, flip and cook second side.

Top with syrup, powdered sugar, peanut butter, jelly, whatever you like.
