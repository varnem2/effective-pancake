DRY RUB PORK RIBS

INGREDIENTS Nutrition
4 racks pork ribs (or as many racks as required)
THE RUB
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1⁄2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 teaspoon mustard powder
2 teaspoons salt
3 teaspoons brown sugar
DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 325°F.
Cut pork ribs into sections of 3 or 4 bones.
Mix remaining ingredients well, sprinkle on both sides of ribs and rub into the meat.
Seal rib sections in foil with a tablespoon of water in each package, and bake for 2 hours on a cookie sheet in the center of the oven.
Open foil carefully as steam escapes.
Can be crisped on a hot BBQ if desired but will be great just the way it is.
(Enjoy with oven cooked potato nuggets for a really simple meal).
