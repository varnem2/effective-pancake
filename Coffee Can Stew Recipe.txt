Coffee Can Stew Recipe

Required:
1 coffee can per person
aluminum foil
oven mitts
stirring spoon
Ingredients:
Per person:
2 strips bacon
1/4lb chicken, hamburger, or stew beef
1/2 potato
1 carrot
1/2 celery
garlic powder
salt
pepper
Notes:
This is similar to a hobo dinner, but with water added. Great for younger ones just starting to cook as long as there is no rush to finish the meal time.
Instructions:
Dice all the vegetables.
Cut the bacon into squares.
Cut the chicken or beef into small pieces.
Place bacon in the bottom of can - the grease helps stop sticking.
Drop in pieces of vegetable and meat - as much as the person will eat.
Add seasoning as desired.
Add 1 or 1.5 cups water.
Cover with an aluminum foil lid.
Place directly in campfire coals.
Cook for 45-60 minutes.
