S'more Pie Recipe

Required:
pie tin
dutch oven
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/3 cup sugar
6 tablespoons butter
2 cups chocolate chips
2 cups mini marshmallows
Instructions:
Either buy a premade graham cracker crust or make your own:
Melt butter. Mix butter with graham crumbs and sugar. Press into pie tin.

Heat dutch oven to about 350 degrees.

Cover graham crust with layer of chocolate chips.
Cook in D.O. for about 5 minutes to melt chips.
Cover chocolate chips completely with layer of mini-marshmallows.
Cook in D.O. for about 10 minutes.
Check every 5 minutes until marshmallows are brown.

Carefully remove pie tin and set to cool. If you can set it in snow or shallow cold water, it will cool the crust faster.

Serves 8, but they'll want more.
