Corn Dogs Recipe
Required:
a tall glass
Ingredients:
4 cups vegetable oil
1 pkg. hot dogs (8 or so)
1/2 C flour
1/2 C yellow cornmeal
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp sugar
1 Tbsp shortening
1/3 C milk
1 egg
8 wooden skewers
Instructions:
Combine flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and sugar into a zip-loc bag at home.

Put hotdogs in a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let sit with the lid on.

Fill a skillet or dutch oven with oil so it is 2 inches deep. (To use less oil, put an empty vegetable can in the skillet with a rock in it to take up space)

Heat the skillet to about 375 degrees.

Add shortening to dry ingredients and cut up with a fork so there are only tiny bits of shortening.
Combine milk and egg in a cup or zip-loc bag.
Pour milk/egg into cornmeal mixture and mix thoroughly.
Pour cornmeal batter into a tall glass.

Remove a hotdog from hot water and dry with a paper towel.
Insert a skewer into the end of the hotdog, leaving and inch as a handle.
Dip hotdog into batter in the tall glass.
Place hotdog into oil and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
